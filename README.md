#### Description:
This program lets the user make a profile, calculates their BMI using the data they enter, interprets their BMI, and guides the best exercises to work on their abs, legs, arms, glutes, shoulders and back, and weight reduction.

The user has three alternatives in the profile section: create an account if they don't already have one, log in if they do, or delete their current account. The user may make a variety of errors, some of which this section is prepared to address. These mistakes may involve entering the wrong usernames or passwords, failing to provide input when one is requested, forgetting that one already has an account and creating a new one using the same information, and supplying invalid input. Each time one of these issues occurs, the user is given a brief explanation of what went wrong and the choice to continue, at which point they are prompted again, or to quit. Given that they are an existing user, their height and weight are also saved to inform them if they have put on or lost weight since their last check. Initially, this component was not included; however, to enhance the user experience, I added it so that users could monitor any BMI-related improvements.

The program's BMI calculator determines the user's BMI using their provided height in meters and weight in kilos. Based on the determined BMI, the appropriate interpretation is provided. If the user already had an account, their BMI and its interpretation from when they last checked as well as their current one will be available to them, allowing them to determine whether or not they have made progress. If the user is new, this BMI data is stored. In this also section, issues like invalid input and no input are dealt with.

The workout component, which allows the user to select what they wish to work on, is the final. After doing this, a list of workouts is provided to help the user with their training sessions. The user can input none to have the program exit if they want not to use the workout section. The user will be prompted to choose either one of the options that are available or none if their choice is not included in the list.

I thought about including a diet plan when writing the program, but I decided against it because the user might have allergies or other health conditions to consider. Instead, it would be best for the user to seek medical advice on this.
